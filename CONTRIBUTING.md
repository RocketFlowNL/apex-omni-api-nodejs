- Avoid console.log in production code

### Example Code Style

/**
 * Get account balance from Apex Omni
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Account balance data
 * @throws {Error} If API request fails
 */
async getAccountBalance() {
    try {
        return await this.makeRequest('GET', '/api/v3/account-balance');
    } catch (error) {
        throw new Error(`Failed to get account balance: ${error.message}`);
    }
}
```
